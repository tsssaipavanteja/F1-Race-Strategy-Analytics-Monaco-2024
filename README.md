# 🏎️ F1-Race-Strategy-Analytics-Monaco-2024

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Monaco Grand Prix 2024 race using Python and Power BI to uncover insights related to:
- Race pace vs finishing position
- Tyre strategy effectiveness
- Pit stop strategy impact
- Final race outcomes and performance trade-offs

The goal was to simulate how a data analyst would support race strategy decisions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Excel
- GitHub

---

## 📊 Dashboards Built (Power BI)
1. **Race Performance Analysis**
   - Average lap time vs finishing position
   - Bubble size represents number of pit stops

2. **Tyre Strategy Analysis**
   - Compound usage across drivers
   - Strategy distribution (Soft / Medium / Hard)

3. **Pit Strategy Analysis**
   - Number of pit stops per driver
   - Impact on race outcome

4. **ML Strategy Insights**
   - Combined view of pace, position, and pit stops
   - KPI cards for race winner, fastest pace, and average pit stops

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Faster lap pace does not always guarantee better finishing position at Monaco
- Drivers with additional pit stops generally lost track position
- Monaco heavily rewards track position and strategy over raw speed
